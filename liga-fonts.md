# A (non-exhaustive) list of fonts that support ligatures

## Open-Source/Free Fonts
I'd recommend trying these first if you're new to using ligatures:
* **[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)**
* **[Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/)**
* **[Monoid](https://larsenwork.com/monoid/)**
* **[Hasklig](https://github.com/i-tu/Hasklig/)**
* **[JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/)**
* **[Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/)**
* **[Cascadia Code](https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code)**

## Paid Fonts
I'd like to say I'm not affiliated with nor sponsored by any of these - they're here because I'd like to maintain a solid list of typefaces that support ligatures.
* **[Pragmata Pro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)** - my personal favourite
* **[Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/)**
* **[Operator](https://www.typography.com/fonts/operator/overview)**
