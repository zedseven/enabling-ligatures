# A (non-exhaustive) list of fonts that support ligatures

* **[Pragmata Pro](https://fsd.it/shop/fonts/pragmatapro/)** - my personal favourite
* **[Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode)** - an open-source, free typeface - I'd recommend it if you're new to using ligatures
* **[Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/)**
